## Currently Building

### 🔥 Active Projects

**[beacon](https://github.com/johnnyfreeman/beacon)** - Distributed API monitoring that scales horizontally without limits. Built on Temporal workflows for bulletproof reliability and exactly-once execution guarantees  
`go` `temporal` `distributed-systems`

**pathfinder** - Enterprise data synchronization pipeline powering real-time AI inference workloads. Kafka streams meet Temporal's durable execution for rock-solid data flows at scale  
`go` `kafka` `temporal` `ai-inference` `internal`

**[datatouille](https://github.com/johnnyfreeman/datatouille)** - Beautiful database TUI that makes exploring your data a joy. Built with Bubble Tea because terminals deserve nice things too  
`go` `bubbletea` `tui` `database`

### 🛠 Tool Philosophy

I build CLI tools because GUIs are where good ideas go to get complicated. My tools follow three rules:
1. **Do one thing well** - No feature creep
2. **Stay out of the way** - Tools should enhance, not obstruct
3. **Be composable** - Unix philosophy wins

## Tech I'm Into Right Now

```
go > rust > php > typescript
```

Why? Go for simplicity. Rust when I need to squeeze performance. PHP because it's underrated. TypeScript when the web calls.

## What I'm Learning

Currently deep diving into:
- Distributed systems at scale (working on beacon)
- Terminal UI design patterns (tint is teaching me a lot)
- Rust's async runtime (still wrapping my head around it)

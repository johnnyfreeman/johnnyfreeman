## Currently Building

### 🔥 Active Projects

**voyager** - A remote script execution engine built specifically for safe agentic control
`rust`

**[hammerhand](https://github.com/johnnyfreeman/hammerhand)** - Cross platform native desktop application for managing processes. Processes can share ENV vars and config through Projects. Processes can be executed once manually, in a loop, or on a schedule.
`rust` `process-manager` `gpui`

**[viewscreen](https://github.com/johnnyfreeman/viewsceen)** - Viewscreen allows you to easily read streamed JSON while running Claude Code in non-interactive mode
`go` `bubbletea` `tui`

**[beacon](https://github.com/johnnyfreeman/beacon)** - Distributed API monitoring that scales horizontally without limits. Built on Temporal workflows for bulletproof reliability and exactly-once execution guarantees  
`go` `temporal` `distributed-systems`

**pathfinder** - Enterprise data synchronization pipeline powering real-time AI inference workloads. Kafka streams meet Temporal's durable execution for rock-solid data flows at scale  
`go` `kafka` `temporal` `ai-inference` `internal`

**[datatouille](https://github.com/johnnyfreeman/datatouille)** - Beautiful database TUI that makes exploring your data a joy. Built with Bubble Tea because terminals deserve nice things too  
`go` `bubbletea` `tui` `database`

### 🛠 Tool Philosophy

I build CLI tools because GUIs are where good ideas go to get complicated. My tools follow three rules:
1. **Do one thing well** - No feature creep
2. **Stay out of the way** - Tools should enhance, not obstruct
3. **Be composable** - Unix philosophy wins

## Tech I'm Into Right Now

```
rust > go > typescript
```

Why? Go for simplicity. Rust when I need to squeeze performance. TypeScript when the web calls.

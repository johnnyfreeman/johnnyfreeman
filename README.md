    philosophy: "Build tools that get out of the way"
}
```

## Currently Building

### 🔥 Active Projects

**[beacon](https://github.com/johnnyfreeman/beacon)** - Distributed API monitoring built for infinite scale  
`go` `temporal` `distributed-systems`

**[tint](https://github.com/johnnyfreeman/tint)** - Cell-based terminal UI component library  
`go` `tui` `terminal`

**[bonsai](https://github.com/johnnyfreeman/bonsai)** - Terminal-based JSON viewer that doesn't suck  
`go` `cli` `json`

### 🛠 Tool Philosophy

I build CLI tools because GUIs are where good ideas go to get complicated. My tools follow three rules:
1. **Do one thing well** - No feature creep
2. **Stay out of the way** - Tools should enhance, not obstruct
3. **Be composable** - Unix philosophy wins

## Tech I'm Into Right Now

```
go > rust > php > typescript
```

Why? Go for simplicity. Rust when I need to squeeze performance. PHP because it's underrated. TypeScript when the web calls.

## What I'm Learning

Currently deep diving into:
- Distributed systems at scale (working on beacon)
- Terminal UI design patterns (tint is teaching me a lot)
- Rust's async runtime (still wrapping my head around it)
